The knowledge base is divided into the following top-level categories:

- **📘 Notes**:  
  Temporary or uncategorized notes, acting as a catch-all for raw ideas and quick captures.

- **📚 Topics**:  
  Centralized knowledge categorized by subject, such as algorithms, data structures, and productivity.

- **🎯 Goals**:  
  Personal and professional objectives, including life goals and habits.

- **🔄 Processes**:  
  Documented workflows, methods, and routines for tasks and recurring activities.

- **📊 Projects**:  
  Active and completed projects, each with its own folder for detailed documentation.

- **💼 Work**:  
  Notes and documentation related to your job, team, or career.

## **Rules for Organization**

### 1. **File Naming**
- Use clear and descriptive file names (e.g., `sorting-algorithms.md`).
- Stick to lowercase and hyphens (`-`) for consistency.

### 2. **Index Files**
- Each folder should have an `index.md` file that acts as a Table of Contents for that category.
- Include links to all related files and a brief description of each.

### 3. **Metadata**
- Add metadata to the top of each note for better organization and searchability:
  ```

  title: Note Title
  tags: [tag1, tag2]
  last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD

  ```
