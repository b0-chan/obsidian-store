Filter Availability: The “Opportunity Team Member” filter is available only on the Pipeline Evolution chart.  <br>2. Opportunity Team Member Section: The filter includes an “Opportunity Team Member” section, displayed below the “Owner” section. The system displays a list of users under this section, allowing selection of team members to filter by.  <br>3.
